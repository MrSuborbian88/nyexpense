= Introduction =
This project seeks to visualize expenses made by New York senators, using [http://www.nysenate.gov/opendata open data].

= Details =

Using a Sparql query and a [http://logd.tw.rpi.edu/ sparql endpoint], this project retrieves expenditure data from New York Open Data, and displays it in a Google Visualization chart.  It then searches for relevant New York Times articles related to the Senator.  It also grabs the Senator's twitter feed (if they have one), or tweets from @NYSenate.
